# MonsterScraper

I had an idea to build an application for managing Monster's Energy Drinks...

Hence I started building a scraper to have a sort of relevant database to begin with...

But they refused to deal with me so I've abandoned the project, so sad.

But hey, this python script is a bit of a mess (I just made it works in 1 day) and is able to scrape all cans from Monster official website in date (21 October 2023) with image optimization included.
